# Global Workforce Layoff Analysis 
This project utilizes SQL and pgAdmin 4 to rigorously clean, wrangle, and analyze layoff data from companies worldwide. 

Data cleaning will incorporate the following:
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize the data
- Null values (blank values)
- Remove any unnecessary or redundant columns

To mitigate potential errors (and for peace of mind), we will create a direct copy of the layoffs table to work on. 

We follow our data cleaning with some exploratory data analysis. We will attempt to answer questions such as:
- **Which industries have the largest number of layoffs in the dataset? Does this depend on the year?**
- **Do countries differ as much as industries do in terms of their layoffs?**
- **Does the size or stage of the company matter regarding how many or what percentage of workers they lay off?**
- **Is it possible to use SQL to calculate the total number of layoffs accumulated each month over several years in the dataset?**
